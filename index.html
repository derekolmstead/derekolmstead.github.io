    <h1>Derek E. H. Olmstead, Ph.D.</h1>
    <p>
      An economist working in electricity markets, market design, and energy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      I am the <a href="https://www.albertamsa.ca/about-us">Administrator & Chief Executive Officer</a> at Alberta's <a href="https://www.albertamsa.ca">Market Surveillance Administrator</a> (MSA). The MSA enforces the legislation, regulations, market rules, and reliability standards in Alberta's electricity and retail natural gas markets. In my role, I am responsible for all of the MSA's activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to being appointed to this position, I was Director, Enforcement and Principal Economist at the MSA, Economic Advisor to the Alberta Electric System Operator, Assistant Director at the Australian Energy Regulator / Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and Analyst at Ontario’s Independent Electricity System Operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      I maintain an active research agenda in energy and environmental economics, industrial organization, and applied econometrics. This research focuses on the competitive and regulated aspects of electricity markets (energy, ancillary services, capacity, forward, and retail markets; transmission and distribution tariff design and regulated cost allocation; treatment of storage and distributed resources; and renewable energy procurement and market integration) in Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hold a Ph.D. in economics from Carleton University and am an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Calgary and an Adjunct Research Professor in the Department of Economics at Carleton University. My research related to electricity markets has been published in, among other places, the <i>Canadian Journal of Economics</i>, <i>The Energy Journal</i>, <i>Energy Economics</i>, <i>Energy Policy</i>, and <i>The Electricity Journal</i>.
